    term: "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)",
    definition:
      "Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental condition that affects how a person acts, interacts with others, communicates, and learns.\n\nWhile autism is described as a neurodevelopmental condition to promote a more inclusive, neurodiversity-affirming perspective, it is also legally recognized as a disability under federal law. This legal classification guarantees that individuals on the autism spectrum have rights to constitutional protections, accommodations, and access to support and resources.",

  {
    term: "Elopement/Wandering",
    definition:
      "A behavior in which an individual on the autism spectrum wanders, runs away, or leaves a safe or supervised area without awareness of danger. Elopement may occur for a variety of reasons, including curiosity, attempts to escape overwhelming sensory environments, a desire to reach a preferred object or familiar location, or disruptions in daily routines. In stressful situations, elopement may also occur as a fight-or-flight response, where the individual instinctively runs due to fear, anxiety, confusion, or sensory overload.",
  },
  {
    term: "Fight or Flight",
    definition:
      "A natural, involuntary survival response that occurs when an individual perceives a threat or becomes overwhelmed. During a fight-or-flight response, an individual may attempt to escape (flight), become physically or verbally reactive (fight), or have difficulty processing instructions. In individuals on the autism spectrum, this response may be triggered by sensory overload, fear, confusion, or heightened stress rather than intentional aggression or defiance.",
  },
  {
    term: "Echolalia",
    definition:
      "The repetition or echoing of words, phrases, or sounds spoken by others. Echolalia may be immediate or delayed and can serve different purposes, including communication, language processing, or self-regulation. Individuals on the autism spectrum may repeat words spoken by others or use phrases from familiar sources such as conversations, media, or past experiences. Repeated speech should not automatically be interpreted as mockery, defiance, or noncompliance.",
